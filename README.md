# Age Detection using Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG)

This project employs the Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature extraction technique combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to detect the age of a person depicted in an image. The HOG method captures the gradient information of an image, which is then fed into the SVM for age classification.

The accuracy achieved by the model is relatively low, which can be attributed to the limited number of images used for training.
